# Phase 2 Implementation Progress - API-Driven Approach

## 🎯 **New Approach: API-Driven Fund Management**

### **What We've Implemented:**
1. **Internal Fund Database** in Supabase with our recommended fund list
2. **Add Funds via App Interface** - enter ticker, assign asset class
3. **Auto-populate from Ycharts API** - fetch all fund details using just the ticker
4. **No CSV uploads** - completely replaced the old workflow

### **What You Can Now Test:**
- Add fund by entering ticker (e.g., "VTSAX", "SPY", "IWF")
- App automatically fetches fund data from Ycharts API
- Assign asset class manually (Large Cap Growth, etc.)
- See populated performance dashboard with real-time data
