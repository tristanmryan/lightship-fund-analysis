## Asset Class Dictionary & Resolver (Priority 2 foundation)

- Introduced a Supabase-backed Asset Class Dictionary with codes, names, group order, and benchmark mapping.
- Added feature flags to allow Supabase-first resolution with config fallback during migration:
  - `REACT_APP_RESOLVER_SUPABASE_FIRST=true`
  - `REACT_APP_ENABLE_CONFIG_BENCHMARK_FALLBACK=false` (disabled in production; Supabase authoritative)
  - `REACT_APP_ENABLE_LEGACY_ASSETCLASS_SHIM=true`
  - `REACT_APP_ENABLE_ALTERNATE_BENCHMARKS=false`
- Prepared resolvers:
  - Asset class resolver (overrides > id > synonyms/name > heuristic)
  - Benchmark resolver (Supabase primary > config fallback)
- Enhanced service to expose normalized fields: `asset_class_id`, `asset_class_code`, `asset_class_name`, `group_name`.
- Wired benchmark overlay in table to use resolver API without visual changes.
 - Added Health route in sidebar for unresolved classes/benchmarks.

Testing-only tools (temporary):
- Admin â†’ Add Fund (manual) behind flag `REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN_MANUAL_ADD` (default ON in dev/preview, OFF in prod). Allows upserting a fund and same-day performance for quick end-to-end checks.
  - After save, caches invalidate and UI refreshes.
  - To disable: set `REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN_MANUAL_ADD=false`.

Current tested state
- Health: 0 unresolved funds; 0 classes missing benchmarks (Supabase-only mode).
- Performance: Symbol column fixed (uses `ticker`), returns render from normalized fields.
- Fund Scores: renders ticker/name/asset class/returns from normalized fields (score shows 0.000 pending scoring wire-up).
- Admin Dictionary: primary benchmark updates persist; cache invalidation/refresh working.
- Manual Add: supports merge vs overwrite of todayâ€™s row; includes 10Y/Alpha/Beta.

### Drilldowns & Compare (Priority 2)

- Drilldown Cards (Risk, Capture, Fees)
  - Normalized fields only; no hardcoded maps
  - Null-safe placeholders (â€”) and tooltips
  - Benchmark deltas where same-day benchmark data exists
  - Access via Performance table row click â†’ Drilldown tab

- Compare View (updated)
  - Normalized getters + unified formatters
  - Benchmark context for 1Y, identical delta styling as table

- Mini-charts (sparkline foundation)
  - Sparkline column added to table (per-fund cached history)
  - Uses available return series; shows "No data" when empty
  - Period toggles implemented (1M/3M/6M/1Y/YTD)
  - Saved view defaults foundation (Phase 3): per-user persistence of filters and table column/sort state via `preferencesService` (IndexedDB)
    - Flag: `REACT_APP_ENABLE_SAVED_VIEWS` (default true)
    - Applies on load; updates automatically when user changes filters/columns/sort

Screenshots
- Performance (table with deltas and sparkline): `docs/screenshots/performance_table.svg`
- Drilldown (risk/capture/fees): `docs/screenshots/drilldown_cards.svg`
- Compare (side-by-side): `docs/screenshots/compare_view.svg`

Manual QA checklist:
- Performance table shows ticker in Symbol column and renders return columns.
- Fund Scores table renders ticker, name, asset class, and return/ratio columns (score may be 0.000 until scoring is wired).
- Benchmark badges show deltas for funds with matching benchmark tickers present in the dataset.
- Health shows 0 unresolved funds and 0 classes missing benchmarks with Supabase-only mode.
- Drilldown cards render with normalized values and benchmark badges where applicable; no layout break with nulls.
- Compare renders side-by-side metrics with normalized fields and consistent formatting.
- Sparkline column renders when history rows exist; shows "No data" otherwise.

Next steps (Priority 2 sequence)
1) Admin MVP: complete CRUD (asset classes; primary/alternate benchmarks; fund overrides), with cache invalidation and basic validations.
2) Drilldown cards and comparison: consume resolver-only; no hardcoded maps.
3) Mini-charts (sparklines) off fund_performance history.
4) Legacy normalization PR: remove remaining `['Asset Class']` reads in scoring/analytics/utils; keep shim until merged.
5) Tests: unit tests for resolvers and delta math; snapshot for Scores table rendering.

Migration sequence (no downtime):
1. Run DB migrations to create dictionary/mapping tables and add `funds.asset_class_id`.
2. Seed classes, synonyms, and primary benchmarks from current config.
3. Backfill `funds.asset_class_id` from legacy `funds.asset_class` via synonyms; report unresolved.
4. Keep flags on (Supabase-first + config fallback) until seeding complete, then disable fallback.

Acceptance criteria:
- Table/Compare consume resolver; deltas/badges stable.
- Admin can change primary benchmark; UI reflects post refresh.
- Health Check shows zero unresolved after backfill.

Risks & mitigations:
- Missing mappings â†’ show Unassigned/hide badges; config fallback enabled.
- API rate/caching â†’ client caches + serverless rate limiting.
# Phase 2 Implementation Progress - API-Driven Approach

## ðŸŽ¯ **New Approach: API-Driven Fund Management**

### **What We've Implemented:**
1. **Internal Fund Database** in Supabase with our recommended fund list
2. **Add Funds via App Interface** - enter ticker, assign asset class
3. **Auto-populate from Ycharts API** - fetch all fund details using just the ticker
4. **No CSV uploads** - completely replaced the old workflow

### **What You Can Now Test:**
- Add fund by entering ticker (e.g., "VTSAX", "SPY", "IWF")
- App automatically fetches fund data from Ycharts API
- Assign asset class manually (Large Cap Growth, etc.)
- See populated performance dashboard with real-time data
