## Technical Architecture (Current State)

### Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
-- Core tables implemented:
- users (multi-user ready)
- funds (centralized registry)
- fund_performance (historical data)
- activity_logs (audit trail)
- snapshots (historical snapshots)
- benchmarks (comparison data)
```

### Key Services
- `authService.js` - Authentication & session management
- `fundService.js` - CRUD operations & Ycharts integration
- `ychartsAPI.js` - External API wrapper with caching & mock fallback
- `api/ycharts.js` - Secure serverless proxy for YCharts API calls
- `migrationService.js` - Data migration utilities
- `useFundData.js` - React hook for data management

### YCharts Integration Architecture
```
Client App ‚Üí ychartsAPI.js ‚Üí Vercel Serverless Function ‚Üí YCharts API
                    ‚Üì (on 403 error)
               Mock Data Fallback ‚Üí Continues Normal Operation
```

**Mock Data Coverage:**
- All performance returns (YTD, 1Y, 3Y, 5Y, 10Y)
- Risk metrics (Sharpe, Std Dev, Alpha, Beta)
- Capture ratios (Up/Down) - Critical for scoring system
- Fund details (Expense ratio, Manager tenure, Fund family)
- Complete scoring system compatibility

### Frontend Architecture
