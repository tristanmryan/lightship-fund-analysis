# AGENTS.md - Lightship Fund Analysis App

## Project Overview
Enterprise-grade fund analysis platform for Raymond James wealth management advisors. Features sophisticated server-side scoring algorithms, real-time data ingestion, comprehensive reporting, and investment committee-ready visualizations.

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript, functional components and hooks
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with custom RPCs and materialized views
- **Hosting**: Vercel with serverless functions
- **Scoring Engine**: Z-score based ranking with configurable profiles and weights
- **Data Pipeline**: CSV ingestion with EOM normalization and validation
- **Export**: Professional PDF reports via React-PDF, Excel/CSV exports

## Development Philosophy
- **Accuracy First**: This impacts real investment decisions - calculations must be mathematically precise
- **Server-Side Performance**: Heavy computations in PostgreSQL, not client browser
- **Advisor-Centric**: Optimized for monthly investment committee workflows
- **Explainable AI**: Scoring model must be transparent and client-presentable
- **Enterprise Ready**: Audit trails, data governance, and compliance-ready

## Key Features to Understand

### 1. **Sophisticated Scoring System**
- **Server-side computation**: Scoring runs in PostgreSQL via RPCs for consistency
- **Multiple scoring models**: Different algorithms for equity vs fixed income vs alternatives
- **Z-score methodology**: Statistical ranking within asset class peer groups
- **Configurable weights**: Admin can adjust metric importance per asset class
- **Breakdown transparency**: Each score shows per-metric contributions

### 2. **Data Architecture**
- **Monthly snapshots**: End-of-month (EOM) normalized performance data
- **Asset class resolution**: Sophisticated mapping with primary benchmark assignment
- **Audit trails**: All changes tracked with user attribution and timestamps
- **Research notes**: Append-only decision logs per fund with decision context

### 3. **Professional Reporting**
- **Investment committee PDFs**: Multi-table layouts with Apple-quality design
- **Excel exports**: Formatted for financial analysis with consistent number formatting
- **Interactive dashboards**: Real-time data with drill-down capabilities

## Core Business Logic

### Scoring Algorithm (src/services/scoring.js)
```javascript
// Z-score based ranking within asset class peer groups
// Excludes benchmarks from peer statistics
// Configurable weights via scoring profiles
// Returns 0-100 scale with breakdown details

final_score = Î£(weight_i Ã— z_score_i) * normalization_factor
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```

â†’ Materialized Views â†’ React Components â†’ Professional Exports
```

### Asset Class & Benchmark Resolution
- **Primary benchmarks**: Each asset class mapped to designated ETF
- **Performance deltas**: Automatic calculation vs benchmark
- **Missing data handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback values

## Database Schema (Supabase)

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Fund registry and performance
funds (id, ticker, name, asset_class_id, created_at)
fund_performance (ticker, date, ytd_return, one_year_return, ..., expense_ratio)
asset_classes (id, name, primary_benchmark_id)
benchmarks (id, ticker, name, asset_class_id)
benchmark_performance (ticker, date, ytd_return, ...)

-- Scoring system
scoring_profiles (id, name, is_default, created_at)
scoring_weights (id, profile_id, scope, scope_id, metric, weight)
metric_stats_as_of (asset_class_id, date, metric, mean, stddev, count)
scores_as_of (asset_class_id, fund_ticker, date, score_final, breakdown)

-- Governance and audit
fund_research_notes (id, fund_id, note, decision, created_at, author)
activity_logs (id, user_id, action, details, created_at)
```

### Key RPCs (Performance Critical)
```sql
-- Data retrieval
get_funds_as_of(p_date) â†’ enriched fund data with performance
get_asset_class_table(p_date, p_asset_class_id, p_include_benchmark) â†’ scored funds + benchmark
get_scores_as_of(p_date, p_asset_class_id, p_limit, p_after) â†’ paginated scored results
get_compare_dataset(p_date, p_tickers[]) â†’ side-by-side comparison data

-- Scoring computation
refresh_metric_stats_as_of(p_date) â†’ compute peer group statistics
refresh_scores_as_of(p_date) â†’ compute all fund scores for date
```

## Code Guidelines

### When Adding Features
- **Check existing patterns**: Leverage established services and components
- **Server-side first**: Move computations to PostgreSQL when possible
- **Maintain scoring accuracy**: Any changes to scoring logic require mathematical validation
- **Feature flags**: Use environment variables for gradual rollouts
- **Test with real data**: Raymond James production-like datasets

### Component Development
- **Composition over complexity**: Reuse existing dashboard components
- **Performance conscious**: Virtualize large fund lists, debounce searches
- **Professional styling**: Raymond James brand standards with Apple-quality polish
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful failure handling for advisor workflows

### Data Processing Standards
```javascript
// Preferred patterns
const fundsByAssetClass = funds.filter(f => f.asset_class_id === targetId);
const cleanTicker = ticker?.toUpperCase().trim().replace(/[^A-Z0-9]/g, '');
const safeNumber = value => isNaN(value) ? null : parseFloat(value);

// Use centralized formatting
import { fmt } from '../utils/fmt';
const displayPercent = fmt.percent(value, { decimals: 2, sign: true });
```
