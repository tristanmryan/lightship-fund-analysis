# Archived / Legacy Docs

These documents describe legacy implementations kept for reference. Current v3 replaces prior table implementations with a unified table and simplified flows.

- docs/MODERN_FUND_TABLE.md (legacy table approaches)
- docs/table-architecture-audit.md (pre-unification audit)
- docs/dashboard_redesign.md (older dashboard design notes)

Note: Files are retained in-place for searchability; future cleanup can move them into a dedicated `docs/archive/` directory.
