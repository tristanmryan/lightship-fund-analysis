This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Admin Options

The **Admin** page allows management of fund lists and benchmark mappings. It also provides controls for adjusting the scoring weights used by the ranking engine. Navigate to the **scoring** tab inside the Admin page to view all metrics and their current weightings. Enter new numeric weights, click **Save** to persist them, or **Reset** to return to the defaults.

### Monthly Snapshot Upload (CSV)
- Behind flag `REACT_APP_ENABLE_IMPORT=true`.
- CSV columns:
  - Required: `Ticker`, `AsOfMonth` (YYYY-MM-DD, end-of-month recommended; non-EOM will warn but can proceed)
  - Supported metrics (upsert into `fund_performance`): `ytd_return, one_year_return, three_year_return, five_year_return, ten_year_return, sharpe_ratio, standard_deviation, expense_ratio, alpha, beta, manager_tenure, up_capture_ratio, down_capture_ratio`
- Units normalization: accepts `12.34`, `12.34%`, or `0.1234` as-is; `expense_ratio` `0.65` means 0.65%.
- Unknown tickers are skipped.
- Import is idempotent on (`fund_ticker`,`date`).

Example CSV:

```
Ticker,AsOfMonth,ytd_return,one_year_return,three_year_return,five_year_return,ten_year_return,sharpe_ratio,standard_deviation,expense_ratio,alpha,beta,manager_tenure,up_capture_ratio,down_capture_ratio
